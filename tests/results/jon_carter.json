ABC News: Tyrone Dalton When pensioner John Carter was moving into care earlier this year, his family was sorting through his belongings and made an alarming discovery. His family describe him as an extremely generous man, who gives his time and money to his local church. The 73-year-old, who lives with cerebral palsy, had been living independently in Bendigo, Victoria on the disability pension before qualifying for the age pension. But a box of bank statements revealed his generosity had been exploited. Over six years he had made more than 800 direct debits to Australian charities, totalling more than $18,000. By 2023, he was giving over $500 each month across more than 20 charities, which accounted for nearly a quarter of his monthly income. As a pensioner, there was no opportunity for Mr Carter to claim the donations back through tax. 'They still wouldn't take no for an answer' Mr Carter said \"pushy\" tele-fundraisers had signed him up for all but one of the payments. \"I did tell them that I was on a pension, they still wouldn't take no for an answer,\" he said. \"They made it sound like they were so important, so urgent, we desperately need your support.\" The financial strain to keep up with the donations forced the pensioner to draw down on his savings. \"I knew my limits. [My savings] dropped by probably half, more than half,\" he said. John Carter\u2019s nephew Gary Van der Linde, who lives nearly 200km away, helped him cancel more than 20 direct debits each month. ABC News: Barrie Pullen I would have had no money eventually, I would have been bankrupt. Statements across two years reveal he paid more than $18,000 to 22 charities between 2018 and 2023. One charity was collecting two direct debits per month. Mr Carter's nephew Gary Van Der Linde, who lives 200 kilometres away in Lilydale, said it has seriously affected the former disability pensioner's finances. \"His savings have gone down very substantially. In the future for when he needs high care, he doesn't have the money,\" he said. Call centres 'need to be put on notice' John Carter's family said his story needed to be a warning to charities and professional fundraisers repeatedly targeting vulnerable individuals. \"These call centres need to be put on notice,\" Gary Van der Linde said. \"The lady in the bank, she said she's seeing it more and more. The elderly come in and they don't know how to cancel them.\" Calling donors is one of the most effective fundraising methods for Australian charities, and the professional fundraising industry is increasing its efficiency with artificial intelligence. Council On The Ageing (COTA) acting CEO Corey Irlam said the increased use of AI meant tele-fundraisers were able to contact donors more frequently. \"The cost of doing so is lower,\" he said. \"They're able to use AI to say 'Yes, this person is interested' then hand them over to a [real] person. \"This is seeing a larger number of donation calls going to the homes of everyday Australians than what we saw three or four years ago.\" He said the frequency of calls could make it harder for older and vulnerable Australians to say no. \"All too often we see businesses and professional fundraisers taking advantage of older people,\" Mr Irlam said. Corey Irlam said tele-fundraisers are using AI to increase frequency of calls, making it harder for vulnerable people to say no. ABC News: Andrew Whitington \"The thing about professional fundraisers is they often work on a commission, and unfortunately, that means that they're susceptible to pressure tactics or frequency of phone calls to wear the donor down. \"That's something that we think the industry fundraising code tries to address, but [it] doesn't always work [in] every situation.\" A self-regulated industry In 2022, the Australian Red Cross engaged professional fundraising firm Dataro which used AI technology to increase donations from standard-level donors. The company said the technology worked out how likely each donor would be to give between $500 and $5,000 a year if \"stewarded effectively\", and increased donations by $505,000 for its 2022 campaign. The professional fundraising industry is self-regulated, and fundraising companies and charities are meant to adhere to the Fundraising Institute of Australia code. John Carter and his niece Ruth Van der Linde and sister Janice Rokesky, who helped him cancel his donations. In a statement, Fundraising Institute of Australia CEO Katherine Raskob said the institute and its members took vulnerability very seriously, and would always work with the donor and their family to understand what happened and refund any donations made. Some of the well-known charities named in Mr Carter's bank statements used now collapsed Brisbane tele-fundraising company Pareto Phone, which is under investigation by the FIA Code Authority. The Brisbane company collected donations on behalf of dozens of well-known Australian charities over the phone for more than to two decades. It folded in October, two months after the ABC revealed it was the subject of a major cyber-attack which saw tens of thousands of donor details and highly sensitive employee records published on the dark web. The company is under investigation by Australia's privacy regulator for alleged breaches of privacy law, and its owner Merchant Place Investments potentially faced a fine of up to $50 million. It's alleged to have retained donor data for years beyond when it was required. Employees of the collapsed company have told the ABC many charities had called phone numbers so old that the donors had died years earlier."
